Chalo-deploy-karte-hain is a front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

 It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.

## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:

* Download the latest stable release from
  (https://iamniteshpandit.github.io/Chalo-deploy-karte-hain//).

  ```bash
  mkdir  Chalo-deploy-karte-hain
  unzip Chalo-deploy-karte-hain
  ```

* Clone the git repo — `git clone
  https://github.com/IAMNITESHPANDIT/Chalo-deploy-karte-hain.git` - and checkout the
  [tagged release](https://github.com/IAMNITESHPANDIT/Chalo-deploy-karte-hain/releases)
  you'd like to use. The `dist` folder represents the latest version of the
  project for end users.

* Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install html5-boilerplate`
  or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add html5-boilerplate`. The resulting
  `node_modules/html5-boilerplate/dist` folder represents the latest version of
  the project for end users. Depending on what you want to use and how you want
  to use it, you may have to copy and paste the contents of that folder into
  your project directory.

* Using our new (https://github.com/IAMNITESHPANDIT/Chalo-deploy-karte-hain.git)
  project, instantly fetch the latest npm published package (or any version
  available on npm) with `npx`, `npm init` or `yarn create` without having to
  install any dependencies. Running the following `npx` command installs the
  latest version into a folder called `new-site`

  ```
  npx create-Chalo-deploy-karte-hain new-website
  cd new-website
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
